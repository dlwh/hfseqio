Extensions for Google's SeqIO library to make it play nice with Huggingface's ecosystem

This project is not affiliated with either Google or Huggingface.


## Installation

### MacOS

On MacOS, you have to manually install tensorflow-text from source, which is a bit involved. See the
[tensorflow-text installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/text#build-from-source-steps).

I can't get it to work with arm64/Apple Silicon at all.
